    Hi I'm Anu!

<div class="about-info">
    <p>
        I'm a junior at Lick-Wilmerding high school in the bay area. I'm passionate about using technology and art to better my community and push towards a more sustainable future. I pursue this mindset through extracurriculars such as architecture, coding, design, and product ideation. On top of this, I created my school's first pen pal club out of a deep curiosity to find out more about what life is like outside of my SF bubble. I also lead the Girl's in Tech club and am helping to organize a hackathon this spring.
